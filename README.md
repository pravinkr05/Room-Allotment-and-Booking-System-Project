# Room Allotment and Booking System Project

## Overview

This project is a prototype model developed in C++ to demonstrate the virtual booking of rooms in a hotel. It serves as a practical implementation of concepts learned during the C++ and Data Structures internship at Internship Studio. The primary data structure used in this project is the array and queue.

## Features
Add all functions

- **Room Booking**: Allows users to virtually book rooms in a hotel.
- **Array Queue Data Structure**: Implements the array queue data structure for efficient room management.
- **User-friendly Interface**: The project provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with the booking system.

## Certificate

This project has been completed as part of a C++ and DS internship, and a certificate is available to verify the successful completion of the program.
