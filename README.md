# Room Allotment and Booking System Project

## Overview

This project is a prototype model developed in C++ to demonstrate the virtual booking of rooms in a hotel. It serves as a practical implementation of concepts learned during the C++ and Data Structures internship at Internship Studio. The primary data structure used in this project is the array and queue.

## Features

- **Room Booking**: Allows users to virtually book rooms in a hotel.
- **Registration**: Allows users to register as a client user.
- **Reservation**: Enables users to reserve a room with a host.
- **Show Reserved Rooms**: Displays the host and room details reserved by the user.
- **Rooms Availability**: Shows the current availability status of rooms.
- **Exit**: Exits from the loop of these functions.
- **User-friendly Interface**: The project provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with the booking system.
- **Array and Queue Data Structure**: Implements the array and queue data structure for efficient room management.

## Output File

The project contains an [output.txt]<span style="text-decoration:none;">(output.txt)</span> file, which contains sample output data from the code.

## Certificate

This project has been completed as part of a C++ and DS internship, and a certificate is available to verify the successful completion of the program.
